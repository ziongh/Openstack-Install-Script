Openstack-Install-Script Controller-and-Computes
=================================================

This script install and initial cloud environment on One Controller with Neutron (network), Glance (images), Nova-controller (virtualization controll). And as many Compute nodes as needed running only the necessary services to have VM instances connected to the cloud.

ComputeNode.py must be installed on all Hosts that are going to run the VMs.
ControllerNode.py must be installed on the Controller node.

## Use

This script assumes that you do have a clean install of Ubuntu and it's network interfaces correct configuration.

BEFORE running this script, please open it and edit the initial lines where the variables are declared with your own Passwords, and change the network interfaces names as you must (e.g. Web_Interface="eth0").

This install requires 3 network interfaces:

* Web Interface => used by tenants to reach the cloud
* Managment Interface => used to interconnect the cloud
* Tunneling Interface => used to exchange data between VM in tenant network

### Not Yet Automatic (so you should read this section..)

The current Script uses IPs to configure host interConnection, so it should be used in an static ip environment. This must be fixed... (TODO: use HostNames instead of IPs)

If the installation is performed through ssh the connection may drop. Requiring the user to continue installation from install_and_configure_dashboard() function. This must be fixed...

After the installation it is required to the user to reconfigure /etc/network/interfaces to attach eth0 to br-ex:

If you are using DHCP, change your Web Interface (e.g. eth0):

	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet dhcp

To:
	
	auto br-ex
	iface br-ex inet dhcp


If you are using Static IP, change your Web Interface (e.g. eth0):

	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet static
	address X.X.X.X

To:
	
	auto br-ex
	iface eth0 inet static
	address X.X.X.X

And add a configuration for your eth0:

	auto eth0
	iface eth0 inet static
	address 0.0.0.0

Then Restart your computer.


## Useful commands
### Reboot all openstack Services:
	$ cd /etc/init/; for i in $(ls nova-* | cut -d \. -f 1 | xargs); do sudo service $i restart; done && cd /etc/init/; for i in $(ls neutron-* | cut -d \. -f 1 | xargs); do sudo service $i restart; done && cd /etc/init/; for i in $(ls glance-* | cut -d \. -f 1 | xargs); do sudo service $i restart; done

### Reboot all openstack Neutron Services:
	$ cd /etc/init/; for i in $(ls neutron-* | cut -d \. -f 1 | xargs); do sudo service $i restart; done

### Reboot all openstack Nova Services:
	$ cd /etc/init/; for i in $(ls nova-* | cut -d \. -f 1 | xargs); do sudo service $i restart; done

### Cat all files in a directory recursively:
	$ cd /etc/; for i in $(find . -name "*.*" -print | xargs); do cat $i; done


## TODO

* Change to use Hostnames instead of IPs
* Configure /etc/network/interface to attach Web Interface IP to br-ex Automatically
